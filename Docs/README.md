# Documentation Index

This folder contains all repository documentation, organized by topic. The main project overview remains in the root README.md.

Contents

- ScriptUsage
  - BulkPDFGenerator.md — Feature overview, Nekudos and Variants logic, prerequisites, and usage.
  - ChangeNekuda.md — Catalog of niqqud conversion scripts with details per conversion and usage.
- Engineering
  - CodeStandards.md — Engineering code standards, safety patterns, and performance guidelines.
  - DialogUXConventions.md — Dialog UI/UX conventions for scripts (layout, scope, buttons).

Notes

- Script sources live under Scripts/.
- Some scripts have their own dedicated README files here to keep usage and prerequisites close to the feature set.
- The historical Deprecated/ folder was removed from master; the full history is preserved in the archive branch.
